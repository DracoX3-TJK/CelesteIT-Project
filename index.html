                    <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">  As the chapter begins the game starts to introduce the Main character of this game which is Madeline. The game tells us, the person playing as Madeline why are we so anxious and nervous. 
                      As we go past the intro we start the game as Madeline, she starts walking into the spotlight as the game opens up to see the full chapter, we start by going towards the mountain or the main goal of the game, 
                      as we head towards it we jump over obstacles that are in our way and we nearly avoid death by a giant ice cube that tries to crush us.

                        In the next room the game teaches us how to climb. After that we jump across 
                        some more obstacles and then we make it to the next room where we meet Granny, she warns usabout the mountain and that there are stange things that happen there but we didn't really believe her. As we go along to
                        the brigde we start running across it and then the brigde starts to crumble, we start running as fast as we possibly can jumping over obstacles until we jump over an impossible jump thinking we are done for until 
                        time freezes and everything stops. A bird comes down from the sky as we are frozen and tells us the ability to dash which saves us, ending the chapter with a new ability.

          Chapter 1: Forsaken City
        </h1>
        <h2 style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">
          As chapter 1 begins, we see that there is some obstacles in the way like spikes so we start jumping over the spikes with our dash and start traversing through the level. In the next room we 
          can see the collectables of the game that will change how the ending looks, Strawberrys. These strawberrys are not required unless you want a certain ending or achievments. Moving past that we move through the level jumping
          on trampolines and dashing from platform to platform until we make it to the next room. The next room has the main mechanic called the Traffic Light Block, what this block does is basically when you activate it by rather standing on 
          it or Grabing onto it, it starts to move at a fast pace on a conveyor belt and stoping at the end of it launching you if you decide to jump off of it. In the room after that it inroduces the winged strawberry which is basically a normal strawberry 
          but if you dash it goes away and you cant get unless your fast enough.
