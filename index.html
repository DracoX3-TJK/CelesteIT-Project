          <p>
          <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"> Ah yes, The Prologue. The beginning of the game where it teaches you
            how to do every “Main”
            mechanic that you will use during your entire playthrough. The first one is to move. To move, you rather
            have to press “W.A.S.D.” /
            the arrow keys on Keyboard or with the left Joystick / d-pad on the controller. Next is to Jump, on keyboard
            you press the Spacebar and
            on controller you press Triangle on Playstation and “A” on Xbox or switch.
          </h2>
          <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
            Next is to climb / Grab, To Grab you have to press the trigger button on the console or you press “Z” on the
            keyboard, you can move up and
            down as much as you want but as soon as you start glowing red then you cannot climb until standing on Ground
            again. The last mechanic you
            need to learn is Dash, on the keyboard it is the “X” button and on Playstation it is Square and on Xbox and
            Switch it is the “X” button as well.

  <button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 1: Forsaken City</h1></button>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      Forsaken City is the chapter where it Introduces the mechanics for that chapter that appears later on in the game.
      First is the Strawberry, the Strawberry is the collectible for the game. To get it you
      just have to run into it, it will follow you around until you're able to stand on solid ground to collect it, if you
      die without standing on solid ground then you lose the Strawberry and you have to collect
      it again. There's also another version of this at Least almost every chapter called the Winged Strawberry, it
      follows the same rules as the normal Strawberry but if you Dash then the Strawberry goes away, You
      can still collect it after you dash but you have to be quick. The second mechanic is the Cassette Tapes, you can
      find these in a hidden room to unlock a harder version of the chapter, these rooms with Cassette
      Tapes also have another mechanic called the Rhythm Blocks. These blocks blink from solid to air in the Rhythm to the
      beat of the music playing in the room. Now onto the Main Mechanics in the Chapter.
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      The first one is pretty simple and it is the Spike, it's one of the many ways you can die in the game to where if
      you touch it then you die. The second mechanic in the chapter is more complicated, it's the Traffic Light Block
      or the Conveyor Belt Platform, this block moves across the Conveyor Belt when grabbed onto or stood on, if you let
      go or jump off the block last second it can launch you across the room and it can rather help or hurt you. The
      next Feature is the Crystal, the Crystal is in most chapters in the game and it is a green Crystal that refills your
      energy / Dash if you collect it. The second to last block is the Breakable Block, if you dash into it then it
      breaks apart. The last mechanic in this chapter is the Falling Block. This Block falls all the way down to the
      bottom of the room but only if you interact with it by climbing on it or landing on it.

  <button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 2: Old Site</h1></button>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Old Site starts off with keeping mechanics from the last chapter like Strawberries or Breakable Blocks but it
    removes some other mechanics like the Traffic Light Blocks. Moving onto the new Mechanics for this chapter which
    introduces close to 25% of the chapter and it's called the Dream blocks, they are starry type blocks that look like
    they're from your imagination. How it works is if you dash into it, you go into a straight line to the other side
    of the block, if there is a wall on the other side though then you die so be careful. The next and last Mechanic in
    the chapter is Badeline. In Chapter 2, she is like a little chase in the level and if she touches you
    then you
    die in the Chapter, it's kinda like Shadow Mario in Mario Galaxy.

<button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 3: Celestrial Resort</h1></button>
<div class="content">
  <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    Chapter 3 introduces a lot more things than chapter 2 so let's get into it. The first new mechanic is the Sludge, it
    is exactly like Spikes but it can go on the wall and ceiling, it's everywhere in the hotel and it's annoying. It
    can also move around making it hard to traverse gaps. The next mechanic is the Sludge-Spawning Tiles, its this path
    that when walked on or slid on will spawn Sludge down there once walked or slid on, it can spawn on the floor or the
    wall.
  </h2>
  <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    The next mechanic is Keys, if there's a passage that's blocked with a Key hole then you'll probably have to look
    around for a Key wherever it might be. After that mechanic is the Sinking Platform, this is a brown type platform
    that
    when stood on will start Sinking slowly. There's another variant to this which is the Moving Platform. This Platform
    looks the same but it moves left to right or up to down repeatedly without needing to be activated. The next
    mechanic
    that thankfully only appears in that chapter is the Platform-Rearranging Buttons, these are buttons that take away
    certain blocks to help you go to the next part so it's like a puzzle. What i believe the mechanic in the chapter is
    Oshiro,
    he appears at the end of the chapter and what he does is spawn on the left side of the screen for phase 1, for phase
    2 he charges up the attack, finally on phase 3 he dashes from the left side of the screen to the right.

<p> </p>
<button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 4: Golden Ridge</h1></button>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      Chapter 4 has less mechanics than chapter 3 but it's still a bit of stuff to cover. The first mechanic is the White 
      clouds, these clouds give you a boost to gain height when jumping off of them. A similar one to it is the Pink clouds, 
      these clouds work the same as White clouds but as soon as you bounce off of it, it disappears for a short period of time. 
      The next mechanic is the Bubble, if you hold a direction while inside the Bubble, it will send you towards that direction 
      giving you a little boost. The last new mechanic in this chapter is the Wind, this Wind mechanic can go rather left or 
      right and a combined feature with this is the Snowball which comes from the right side of the screen and goes to the left, 
      its basically Oshiro but it doesnt charge up its attack.
  </h2>
</div>
<p> </p>
<button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 5: Mirror Temple</h1></button>
<div class="content">
  <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
    This chapter brings a lot more mechanics like the Dashing Platforms, these Platforms are like the Traffic Light Blocks but 
    it activates when you Dash. The next mechanic is the Dash switches, these switches when dashed into open up a gate that you 
    can go through. We also encounter a new version of the Bubble called the Red Bubble. These Bubbles work exactly the same as 
    the normal Bubble but instead of it, giving you a normal boost, it brings you all the way to a wall in a straight line kinda 
    like the Dream Blocks but it doesnt kill you if you hit a wall. The final new mechanic is the Seekers. These guys are like Oshiro but can move in 
    any direction, but only attacks when it sees the player. 
</h2>

<p> </p>
<button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 6: Reflection</h1></button>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      Chapter 6, only introduces a few new mechanics like the Feather, which allows you to move in any direction for a short period 
      of time. The next one is Water, which is like a Feather, but not as fast and it lasts forever. The next mechanic is called 
      the Bumpers, these guys run into you to give you a little shockwave effect blasting you in any direction but only if you run 
      into them. A pretty similar mechanic after that is Kevin, this guy is idle for the entire time except if you Dash into him, he will start moving 
      the direction he was dashed into. The final new mechanic is Badeline… again. This time this is a chase where you gotta run into 
      Badeline without being shot by one of her lasers or orbs. After your done with the chapter, you get an extra Dash to help you with chapter 7.
  </h2>
</div>
<p> </p>
<button class="collapsible"><h1>Chapter 7: The Summit</h1></button>
  <div class="content">
    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      This is the final main chapter of the game and one of the longest chapters in the game because this chapter brings back most 
      mechanics from every single chapter but not all of them but someting in the chapter that will help is purple orbs that will give you 
      a little upwards boost help you get through each chapter all over again, the mechanics that are brought back are the Traffic Light Block, 
      Dream Blocks, Sludge, Wind, White and Pink clouds, Red Bubbles, Normal Bubbles, Keys, Moving Platforms, Sinking Platforms, Dashing Platforms, 
      Temple Gates, and more. Once you have reached the final part of the chapter it introduces one new thing and some old stuff that youll need to do inside 
      the chapter. The one new mechanic is checkpoints where it just leaves a small little checkpoint for you at a certain place. Now for 
      the old mechanics like the Wind but this time its moving downwards or upwards, affecting how you jump. The mechanic 
      after that is the Feather which can be hard to traverse through different Crystals which are basically like Spikes making it harder to 
      complete the chapter, the final mechanic before you reach the end of the game is the White and Pink clouds which do give you a little boost but it depends on 
      which way the wind is facing.
